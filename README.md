## Saif-ul Hussain

I have spent my career within the Civil Service, working within various departments including the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and HM Revenues and Custom. 

I have attained numerous performace awards from various Government departments. Which includes a commendation for my contribution to the Home Office team responsible for the monitoring and maintenance of the Police National Computer.

I have always had a strong interest in coding and an interest in understanding the logic that drives applications and what makes them work. I have a very keen interest in understanding further into Artificial Intelligence, and the benefits that it can bring within society. The ability for an AI based application to identify a solution based on complex algorithms from vast datasets, is an interesting field to explore to build effective automation tools.

Upon successfully acquiring Scholarship opportunity with the renowned Makers Academy, I have completed an intensive Software Development course, to build my knowledge and technical expertise to become a capable, competent and effective Software Developer.
